=================

This game takes its primary mechanic from the popular arcade game Pong. Unlike Pong, however, this game takes place in three-space, using simple perspective tricks. The player plays using the paddle of their choice. The program is calibrated using the webcam to pick up on the color they select (literally any object is a viable paddle) to register as the paddle.

The game is also moddled after that classic story, Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes, the ball being replaced by a tomato, and the paddle by a spatula. The theme song plays in the background.
